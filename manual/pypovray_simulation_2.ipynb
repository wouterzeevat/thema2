    "When we create an animation that runs for 30 seconds at 25 frames per second there is a total of **750** frames to be rendered. This will take a long time to do while during development, you might be interested in only a few frames to check if objects are correctly positioned. In assignments **1** and **2** we created single-frames using the `render_scene_to_png` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    povray.render_scene_to_png(frame, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "We skipped explaining the `0`-argument given to this function which we can use to specify a specific *frame*. To render frame 30 we could simply use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    povray.render_scene_to_png(frame, 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "which creates a single image representing frame number 30 (i.e. the `frame` function is provided the integer `30` as the value of the `step` variable). This will become especially useful when we want to render a specific moment in our simultation without waiting for the whole process to finish. The frame number can *also* be specified as a `list` or `range()` object. The following example renders only the frames `72-93`:\n",

    "In the previous assignments we used the current frame (the `step` argument) to guide our animation. In the example we used this number to calculate if we were halfway through our animation to change the direction of the object. In this document we will create an animation consisting of multiple parts and you might want to keep track of the duration of each part in *seconds* instead of *frames*. This is just an alternative method which requires you to calculate where - in seconds - we are in the process. This is easy enough using the numeric values taken from the `SETTINGS` object which stores all content from your configuration file. The following line calculates *where* in the animation we are for the **current** step:\n",

    "This is purely a guide-method that you might use if you'd rather think in seconds then in frame numbers. To use this calculation you can add the above and the following line to your `frame(step)` function to calculate and show (actually, *log*) where we are:\n",

There are other web resources for non-protein molecules such as the [*World of Molecules*](http://www.worldofmolecules.com) and the [*Automated Topology Builder*](https://atb.uq.edu.au/index.py) (ATB). Performing a plain internet search combining your molecule of choice with the **PDB** term also often results in a PDB file.\n",

    "* Many PDB files lack a certain column of data which results in atoms not being recognized and displayed as hydrogen (default) atoms. The `pypovray` library reports on any missing element names. These element names *should* be placed at columns 77-78 (see the PDB [ATOM](http://www.wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format-content/format33/sect9.html#ATOM) description for further details).\n",

    "Besides moving, a `PDBMolecule` object can also be *rotated*, in all directions. To rotate a molecule you need to provide at least the axis to rotate on (use your legend!) and the *angle* to rotate with, in **radians**. Rotating can be done with the `rotate` method:\n",

    "    ethanol.rotate([1, 0, 0], 0.2)\n",

    "where we rotate the ethanol molecule around the x-axis with `0.2` radians. To see how radians relate to degrees (and how you can convert between these two if needed), use a simple internet search. For further details and an example, see the [`template_pdb.py`](https://bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray/raw/master/template_pdb.py) file and the output on the [`pypovray`](https://bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray) repository main site, 2nd animation shown on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that rotating a molecule is a *persistant* modification of the molecule. This means that if you rotate it by 10 degrees on the x-axis in frame **1**, it retains this position in the next frame where you can rotate it by another 10 degrees. You do not need to use the `step` variable to calculate the angle. You could however calculate the angle you want to rotate with per step.\n",

    "* ATP activates the proton pump and reduces to ADP\n",
    "* H+ protons traverse through the pump to the extracellular space\n",

    "To program these steps requires somewhere between 60 and 200 lines of code (just an estimate) depending on how 'nice' you will make the movements of all elements. Until now we placed most of our code in the `scene` function which is fine for what we have done so far. But for a simulation with multiple steps such as this, putting all the code into that single function is not what we want, it will get cluttered, hard to read and very hard to maintain or change.\n",
