    "# Animating\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have played a bit with positioning objects in 3D space, the next step will be animating objects in 3D space. The code that we will use is available in the downloaded `pypovray` package, see the [`template.py`](https://bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray/raw/master/template.py) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will show how to simply move a single `Sphere` from left to right (and vice-versa) in our scene. The document is concluded with two assignments where we will animate a single object and use the `Camera` as a movable object. First, we will discuss what we need in order to be able to create a simple animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "While the idea of simply moving an object from left to right etc. sounds very straightforward, it involves quite a number of extra steps compared to just drawing a `Sphere` as we've done in the [`Povray Basics`](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray/raw/master/manual/pypovray_basic.ipynb) document. Before we will start with examining the mentioned template file, let's discuss these extra steps and some of the specifics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our previous examples resulting in a single *still* image. A movie or in our case an *animation* is a collection of images each saved into a single file. Each separate image is called a **frame** in the animation. Our job is thus to create a series of images and feed it to some software that will make a movie out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purpose, to create a frame, we construct a single scene and render this into an image file. For instance we have a `Sphere` located at `[`<font color='red'>0</font>`,` <font color='blue'>0</font>`,` <font color='green'>0</font>`]` and we want to move it to `[`<font color='red'>20</font>`,` <font color='blue'>10</font>`,` <font color='green'>0</font>`]`. Our first scene shows the `Sphere` at the starting coordinate and each following scene increases the `x`- and `y`-coordinate until it reached its destination position. Once we've defined *what* we want to show, we need to decide on the following very important **two** settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How long will our animation run for?\n",
    "* How *smooth* do we want our animation to be?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's say we want the `Sphere` to take exactly **2 seconds** to move from `[`<font color='red'>0</font>`,` <font color='blue'>0</font>`,` <font color='green'>0</font>`]` to `[`<font color='red'>20</font>`,` <font color='blue'>10</font>`,` <font color='green'>0</font>`]`, the *duration* will thus be `2`. The *smoothness* is defined by the number of *Frames Per Second*, generally denoted as **FPS**. It is often sufficient to render around **20 FPS** to get a smooth result, but this also depends on the movement of objects. If we look at the included `pypovray` configuration files we see that the `prototype.ini` defines 15 FPS and the `default.ini` 30 FPS. The reason why for prototyping (i.e. *testing*) the FPS is much lower is because this number defines how many frames we have to render and rendering is a *computationally expensive* operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this example we will set the FPS value to `30`. With these two numbers and the start- and end-coordinate of our `Sphere` we can answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many frames do we need to render, or *how many frames do we need to construct*?\n",
    "    * This can simply be answerd by multiplying the `duration` with the `FPS`: `2 * 30 = 60` frames in total\n",
    "* With what value do we need to increase the <font color='red'>x</font> and <font color='blue'>y</font> coordinates each frame?\n",
    "    * Let's take the <font color='red'>x</font>-coordinate for example. We want it to move from `0` to `20` (i.e. move it to the right). We can take the difference between the end and the start and divide this by the *total number of scenes*:\n",
    "        * `(20 - 0) / 60 = 20 / 60 =~ 0.33`\n",
    "    * Concluding; for each frame, we need to increase the <font color='red'>x</font>-coordinate with ~ `0.33` to move the `Sphere` in 2 seconds from `0` to `20`.\n",
    "    * For the <font color='blue'>y</font>-coordinate, this value is:\n",
    "        * `(10 - 0) / 60 = 10 / 60 =~ 0.16`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we store these values in a set of variables and use them where needed. The following code shows how we could do these calculations. How to *use* the values is shown thereafter.\n"
