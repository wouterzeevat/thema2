    "# 1 PyPovray Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the objects we include a `style` variable which the official documentation denotes with `[OBJECT_MODIFIERS...]`. See the *Povray Object Styling*, chapter 2 below for details on how to style Povray objects. Other *Object Modifiers* such as `scaling`, `rotating`, etc. are demonstrated in chapter 3 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the objects shown in this chapter can be imported from the `vapory` library with their listed name.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 The `Sphere` Object\n",
    "\n",
    "The [official](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.2/283/) documentation lists two parameters, the `Center` and the `Radius`. The `Center` is a *vector* specifying a 3D coordinate. In Python we use a list with three values; `[`<font color='red'>x</font>`,` <font color='blue'>y</font>`,` <font color='green'>z</font>`]` as the coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray/raw/master/manual/files/object_sphere.png\" width=\"350\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Radius` is a single number (`float`) definining the size of the `Sphere` where the *radius* is half the *diameter*. If for instance we specify a `Sphere` with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sphere([2, 5.5, -2], 2, style)\n",
    "\n",
    "We get a `Sphere` located at `[`<font color='red'>2</font>`,` <font color='blue'>5.5</font>`,` <font color='green'>-2</font>`]` with a total size (*diameter*) of **4**, twice the *radius*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 The `Box` Object\n",
    "\n",
    "The [official](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.2/283/) documentation lists two `Corner`-parameters as shown by the figure below: <img src=\"https://bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray/raw/master/manual/files/object_box.png\" width=\"350\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to have a `Box` of which all sides are **5** long, we could specify it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Box([2, 2, -3], [7, 7, 2], style)\n",
    "\n",
    "For all three axis we place `Corner_2` at distance **3** from `Corner_1`. To make it a rectangle we could change the <font color='blue'>y</font>-coordinate in `Corner_2` from 7 to 5 for instance to get a rectangle laying above the floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 The `Cylinder` Object\n",
    "\n",
    "The [official](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.0/278/) documentation shows three parameters, also shown in the following image: <img src=\"https://bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray/raw/master/manual/files/object_cylinder.png\" width=\"350\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The `base`- and `cap`-points are both *vectors* which we again specify with the three coordinates. The `Radius` behaves the same as with the `Sphere` object to define the width of the `Cylinder`. A `Cylinder` standing on the 'floor', with a *heigth* of **6** and a *width* (2\\*radius) of **3**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cylinder([0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0], 3, style)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 The `Cone` Object\n",
    "\n",
    "This object takes a total of four arguments according to the [official](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.2/277/) documentation and shown in the following image: <img src=\"https://bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray/raw/master/manual/files/object_cone.png\" width=\"350\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters are two *sets* of values, one for the bottom and one for the top of the `Cone`. Both `Base Points` are *vectors* with the three coordinates and both `Radius` parameters are used to specify the width of the *base* (bottom) and *cap* (top). To create a `Cone` resting on the 'floor' with a *width* (2\\*radius) of **4** pointing upwards with *heigth* of **5** and a sharp point at its top (by using a cap-`Radius` of **0**), use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cone([0, 0, 0], 4, \n",
    "         [0, 5, 0], 0,\n",
    "         style)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 The `Plane` Object\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of object can be used to draw a 'floor' or the 'sky' in a scene as it can easily made to look like it extends *indefinately*. The [official](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.1/297/) manual shows two parameters being present; the `Normal` and the `Distance`. Please read the manual for details on these arguments, but since this can be rather complex, the following example code places a 'floor' at <font color='blue'>y</font>`=-1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Plane([0, 1, 0], -1, style)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.6 The `Text` Object\n",
    "\n",
    "This object type is different from the rest since it is not a single object with a certain shape, but we define a \"string\" which is then *extruded* in 3D. The [official](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.2/287/) documentation shows five parameters. The following command shows the text **Hello!** using the `timrom` font:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Text('ttf', '\"timrom.ttf\"', '\"Hello!\"', 1, 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the extra quotes for the second and third arguments. This is needed when we want to use \"strings\" as arguments for Povray. The arguments are as follows:\n",
    "* `'ttf'`: to specify that we want to use a *TrueType* font, which is also the only font-type supported.\n",
    "* `'\"timrom.ttf\"'`: the actual font to use, should point to an actual file. This arguments requires extra double quotes!\n",
    "* '`\"Hello!\"'`: the string to show in 3D. This arguments requires extra double quotes!\n",
    "* `1`: the *Thickness* of the text or the *extrusion-heigth*. The amount of depth to give the text.\n",
    "* `0`: the offset for positioning the text, mostly set to `0`. Positioning of the text is easier using the `translate` modifier discussed in section 3.3 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.6 The `Scene` Object Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "While not really *objects* compared to a `Sphere` or a `Cylinder`, the following objects are used to create the `Scene` around the objects from the previous sections. An actual `Scene` is then built using with for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scene(Camera, objects=[ LightSource, Plane, Background, Sphere ])\n",
    "\n",
    "One more parameter of the `Scene` object compared to the `objects=[]` is the `included=[]`. Povray is shipped with a number of *include* files that define styles or shapes. The `glass.inc` file for instance contains colors for representing glass objects named `Col_Glass_Winebottle`, `Col_Glass_Clear`, etc. It also contains `Finish` and `Interior` examples (see section 2.1 and 2.3 below).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.6.1 The `Camera` Object\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important object in a `Scene` is the `Camera` as this object defines what we will actually *see*. The [official](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.1/245/) documentation lists a large number of arguments, but the (official) manual regarding [*placing the camera*](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.1/246/) explains this more in-depth. The most basic - complete - `Camera` object can be defined with (compare this with the first example of the *placing the camera* manual):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Camera('location', [3, 5, -10], 'look_at', [0, 2, 1])\n",
    "\n",
    "These two parameters (the 'location' with its list of coordinates and the 'look_at' with its list of coordinates) are practically all that you need. If something specific is wanted it is best to search and translate the found Povray code to Python code yourself, see for example these [camera specials](http://www.f-lohmueller.de/pov_tut/camera_light/camera_e2.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.6.2 The `LightSource` Object\n",
    "\n",
    "All scenes should include at least one `LightSource` producing *rays* for the Povray *ray-tracer*. The [official](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.0/308/) documentation lists two actual parameters (`Location` and `Color`) and a large number of (type specific) extra modifiers. The `pypovray` project includes a few `LightSources` defined as follows in [`models.py`](https://bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray/raw/master/povray/models.py):\n",
    "\n",
    "    LightSource([2, 8, -20], 'color', [1, 1, 1])\n",
    "\n",
    "This command creates a default type of light, namely a *Point* light. Other types are for instance a [`Spot`](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.0/310/)-light, a [`Cylindrical`](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.0/311/)-light (can be used to simulate a laser), a [`Parallel`](http://www.povray.org/documentation/view/3.6.0/312/)-light to simulate the sun, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first two parameters are common to all light types: \n",
    "* the `Location` vector gives the location of the light and\n",
    "* the COLOR gives the color and *brightness* of the light.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Color` is defined with a list of `[`<font color='red'>R</font>`,` <font color='green'>G</font>`,` <font color='blue'>B</font>`]` (Red-Green-Blue) colors. To get a red-light, we could use `[`<font color='red'>1</font>`,` <font color='green'>0</font>`,` <font color='blue'>0</font>`]` and for a white-light (default) it is `[`<font color='red'>1</font>`,` <font color='green'>1</font>`,` <font color='blue'>1</font>`]`, etc. Besides the color these values also define the brightness. To double the light-output of our white light we could simply use `[`<font color='red'>2</font>`,` <font color='green'>2</font>`,` <font color='blue'>2</font>`]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a shortcut for creating white-lights by just defining a single value which is then used for all three colors:\n",
    "\n",
    "    LightSource([2, 8, -20], 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mostly it is a bit trial-and-error to get the lighting good, not just the color but also the position. Sometimes it is better to use multiple `LightSources`. In [*assignment 1*](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray/raw/master/manual/pypovray_basic.ipynb) a single `LightSource` doesn't really work well, so we could include an extra four `LightSources` scattered around that are available in the `models.py` module:"

By default the background of a rendered image is black (`[`<font color='red'>0</font>`,` <font color='green'>0</font>`,` <font color='blue'>0</font>`]`) and we can change this by creating a `Background` object and supplying it to the `Scene`:\n",
