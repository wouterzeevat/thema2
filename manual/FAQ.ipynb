    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "These errors are not always easy to spot since we get no feedback *at all* about where something is wrong. Therefore the easiest method of *debugging* this error is the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in assignment 2 we created a scene consisting of about 9 objects, a camera and a lightsource. Our `Scene` object might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scene(povray.default_camera, objects=[box1, box2, box3, box4,\n",

    "If we now get the error and want to find out *which* object causes it, we could modify **only** the `Scene` object as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scene(povray.default_camera, objects=[#box1, box2, box3, box4,\n",
    "                                          #cone1, cone2, cone3, cone4,\n",

    "\n",
    "We now *commented out* all the `Boxes` and `Cones` (they won't be included in the image) and after running our script we see that there is no issue anymore. This means that the error is caused by either one or more of the `Boxes` or `Cones`. So, the next step would be to change our `Scene` to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scene(povray.default_camera, objects=[box1, box2, box3, box4,\n",
    "                                          #cone1, cone2, cone3, cone4,\n",

    "\n",
    "where we now added all the `Boxes` and kept the `Cones` hidden. If we still get the error, we now know the problem lies with the `Boxes`. Now we can refer to the [Povray Objects and Styling](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/mkempenaar/pypovray/raw/master/manual/povray_objects.ipynb) manual to see if we made an obvious mistake somewhere. If we did not get the error however it is clear that it is one of the `Cones` causing it. You can then proceed to exclude each `Cone` separately to find the mistake.\n",

    "# I Get The 'movie.mp4' already exists. Not overwriting - exiting Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The `povray` packages uses the `ffmpeg` software to create mp4 video files. This software does not overwrite existing files, so getting this error message means that you already have an mp4 file with the name as configured in the configuration (`.ini`) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, rename the existing file to something different or - before running your simulation - change the `OutputPrefix` parameter in the configuration file to give the new output file a different name.\n",

    "# Running Povray through SSH Doesn't Work: `ImportError: No module named 'vapory'`\n",
    "\n",
    "When I login through SSH on the `bioinf.nl` netwerk, I cannot run my `povray` code, getting the `ImportError: No module named 'vapory'` error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is intended behaviour and easy to solve. When you login through SSH you 'land' on one of our servers (mordor) which should *only* be used as a login-server. This means that you should connect to another system on the network to do the actual work. So, once you are logged in on mordor you perform another SSH command to reach a different system;\n",
    "\n",
    "    ssh bin255\n",
    "\n",
    "which lands you on a workstation in the H1.12 room and here you can perform your assignments. While it is perfectly fine to use one of our workstations to run your `povray` code to create a movie, this does create a heavy load on the system and should only be done when no one else is using it (you can check with the `who` command or on our [`status`](https://bioinf.nl/~piet/status) webpage).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rendering Movies through SSH\n",
    "\n",
    "To render a movie or a very comlex single image, it is best to SSH to one of our bigger servers that can more easily sustain such heavy loads and have more processing power too. Select either `idefix` (24 cores, 96GB RAM) or `assemblix` (80 cores, 512GB RAM) for such tasks using one of these commands:\n",

    "# I want to switch between configuration files; How do I do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pypovray` project includes two configuration files; the `default.ini` and the `prototype.ini`. The `default.ini` file is used every time you create an image or a simulation but as you will find out the rendering can take a lot of time. This is mostly because the `default.ini` file creates a high-resolution image with high quality settings. So during development it might be better to use a lower resolution output with lower quality to get your results more quickly. The `prototype.ini` specifies exactly that, so it is recommended to use this file during development. The following code shows how to do this:"
